# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Industry

I'm excited to share with you what I've learned about **"Revenue Insights in Hospitality Industry."**

What I've Learned: I've dived into the challenges hotels face and used my skills to analyze data and solve real problems.

**The Project:** I worked on a project to help the Revenue team at hotels by giving them useful insights from data. It's been cool to use data analysis to tackle real-world problems and help make smart decisions.

**What I've Created:** I made a live dashboard using a tool called Power BI. This dashboard shows important info about hotels:

**RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** This tells us how much money each room makes.

**ADR (Average Daily Rate):** It's the average amount people pay for a room.

**DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):** This tracks how many rooms are booked each day.

**DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** This is the number of rooms available for sale each day.

**DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** It shows how many rooms are actually used by customers every day.

This project was a great learning experience, figuring out the specific challenges and insights in the hotel world. Every industry has its own unique data puzzle to solve.
