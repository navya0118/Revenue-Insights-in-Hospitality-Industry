I'm excited to share with you what I've learned about **"Revenue Insights in Hospitality Industry."**

I worked with AtliQ Grands, a well-known luxury hotel chain, to boost their market share and revenue through "Business and Data Intelligence" strategies. Our main goal was to make a Power BI dashboard for analyzing their historical data in real-time.

**Key tasks included:**
1. Creating an interactive Power BI dashboard.
2. Implementing important hospitality metrics like RevPAR, ADR, DBRN, DSRN, and DURN.
3. Analyzing past data to find ways to increase revenue.
4. Offering practical insights for pricing and occupancy decisions.

**Throughout the project, I gained skills and knowledge in:**
1. Using Power BI for data analysis and visualization.
2. Understanding crucial hospitality metrics and KPIs.
3. Making data-driven decisions for optimizing pricing and occupancy.
4. Presenting data effectively to support strategic decision-making.

**Key Metrics Used:**

**RevPAR** (Revenue Per Available Room): This tells us how much money each room makes.

**ADR** (Average Daily Rate): It's the average amount people pay for a room.

**DBRN** (Daily Booked Room Nights): This tracks how many rooms are booked each day.

**DSRN** (Daily Sellable Room Nights): This is the number of rooms available for sale each day.

**DURN** (Daily Utilized Room Nights): It shows how many rooms are actually used by customers every day.

This project was a great learning experience, figuring out the specific challenges and insights in the hotel world. Every industry has its own unique data puzzle to solve.
